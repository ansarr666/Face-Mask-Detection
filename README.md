# Face Mask Detection using CNN (MobileNetV2)

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect face masks in images.  
It uses **transfer learning with MobileNetV2**, data augmentation, and Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability.


- Detects `with_mask` vs `without_mask` classes.
- Achieved **~99% accuracy** on the test set.
- Provides Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize model attention.
- Includes pre-trained model (`.h5`) and sample images for testing.
